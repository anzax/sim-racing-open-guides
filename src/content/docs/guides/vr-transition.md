title: VR Transition Notes (Planned)
description: Placeholder for migrating from triples to virtual reality headsets without losing pace.
status: planned
---

> Capture your experiments moving between triples and VR. Replace this outline with concrete steps once you gather data.

## Prep work

- List compatible headsets, required PC specs, and room-scale constraints.
- Log baseline lap times and comfort metrics on your existing monitor setup.

## Dialing in VR FOV

- Explain how to set IPD correctly and calibrate vertical alignment.
- Document motion sickness mitigation strategies (frame smoothing, reprojection tweaks).

## Input & telemetry adjustments

- Describe any button box or dash relocations needed when entering VR.
- Note overlay tools (Crew Chief, SimHub) and how to anchor them in-helmet.

## Benchmark targets

| Sim | Headset | Render Resolution | Avg FPS | Notes                |
| --- | ------- | ----------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| TBD | TBD     | TBD               | TBD     | Add data once tested |

## Back-to-back testing protocol

1. Run identical stints in VR and triples on the same combo.
2. Share telemetry overlays highlighting pace differences.
3. Summarize comfort ratings (1â€“5) after each session.

Flag sections that still need data with `TODO` so reviewers understand what remains.
