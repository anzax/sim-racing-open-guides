## Sim Racing Screens 101

- **Correct FOV:** Step-by-step measurement workflows and calculators for each sim.
- **Display choices:** When to stay single-screen, upgrade to ultrawide, or commit to triples.
- **Panel tech:** VA vs. IPS vs. OLED pros and cons, response time tuning, and HDR calibration.
- **Ergonomics:** Eye-to-screen distance, monitor angles, and seat positioning cues.

## Share game configs

- Post your per-title resolution and FOV tables.
- Note DLSS/FSR presets, sharpening filters, and weather visibility tweaks.
- Include driver versions, motion blur preferences, and HUD scale tips for readability.

## Share your builds

- Document cockpit frames, wheelbases, pedals, shifters, and handbrakes.
- Capture seats, harnesses, tactile setups, and DIY accessories like button boxes or dash mounts.
- Link to galleries, CAD files, and sourcing spreadsheets to help others replicate your rig.

## What this hub covers

- **Screen setups:** geometry, mounting hardware, calibration, and troubleshooting.
- **Sim rig builds:** cockpit selection, hardware integration, and upgrade paths.
- **Setup & configuration:** graphics tuning, telemetry overlays, and comfort adjustments.
- **Tips & community wisdom:** workflow checklists, maintenance reminders, and shared learnings.
